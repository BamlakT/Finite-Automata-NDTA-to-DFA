## Finite Automata Nondeterministic to Deterministic Conversion Project


This repository contains the code and documentation for the "Finite Automata Nondeterministic to Deterministic Conversion" project that was completed as part of the coursework at EFERI University. The project focuses on implementing an algorithm to convert a nondeterministic finite automaton (NDFA) into a deterministic finite automaton (DFA).

#Project Overview
A finite automaton is a mathematical model used to represent and analyze systems that have a finite set of states and transitions between those states. Nondeterministic finite automata (NDFA) can have multiple transitions for a single input symbol from a given state. Deterministic finite automata (DFA), on the other hand, have a single transition for each input symbol from a given state. Converting an NDFA to a DFA is important for simplifying the analysis of the automaton and making it more efficient to simulate.

This project implements an algorithm that takes an NDFA as input and produces the corresponding DFA as output. The conversion involves determining the states of the DFA, the transitions, and the acceptance states. The algorithm employs techniques like subset construction to achieve this conversion.
